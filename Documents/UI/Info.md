Welcome to Putt IQ where a more consistent and fluid putting stroke awaits.

Q. Why is tempo important in the putting stroke?

1. Promotes Consistency

A consistent tempo ensures that your stroke length and speed match up properly. That synchronisation leads to  better putting performance.


2. Helps Control Distance (Speed Control)

When tempo stays the same, your only variable becomes the length of your stroke, making distance control far more reliable.


3. Improves Rhythm and Feel

A smooth, even tempo creates a natural rhythm that enhances your touch and feel. 


4. Reduces Tension

A steady tempo keeps your muscles relaxed, particularly in the hands and forearms. Tension leads to jerky or decelerating strokes. A relaxed, rhythmic motion promotes a free-flowing stroke that repeats under pressure.

Q. When do I pull the putter back and start the stroke?

A. The light bar displays when the putting stroke should be taking place. On all of the putting tones there’s an audible beep that is the cue to start the stroke on the next beat.


Q. Should my putting tempo be the same for long and short putts?

A. Yes. On short putts the putter should travel less distance in the same time, and on long putts more distance in the same time. Stroke length is the differentiating factor in putts of different lengths.

Q. Why is the app defaulted to 76bpm?

A. 76bpm is tour average tempo. The app tempo ranges from 70-80 bpm.


Q. What’s a 2:1 putting ratio and how does the app help develop that in the putting stroke?

A. Top putters have a 2:1 tempo ratio, meaning that the backswing takes twice as long as the down swing. When putting, the backswing has two stationary points. The putter head starts from a stationary position  at set up and is briefly stationary at the culmination of the backswing before beginning the downswing. 

In the downswing the putter head is only stationary at one point, when the transition from backswing to downswing occurs. This coupled with the putter head accelerating caused by the putter head finishing the stroke ahead of the point of impact, leads to a 2:1 ratio. 

The app helps lock in this 2:1 ratio as the stroke becomes more synchronised and consistent.

Q. What’s the lightning bolt mode and how does it work?

A. After practicing your putting stroke to tempo you can test yourself using ‘strike mode’. Strike mode cuts off the last beat of the audio and measures your stroke. Your strike will be displayed in the light bar. 

With a perfect stroke the strike will be displayed in the middle, directly above the golf ball. If your stroke is too quick for your strike will be displayed to the right of the ball, and if too slow to the left.
