# PuttIQ Audio System Fix Status
**Date:** December 15, 2024
**Status:** Partially Fixed - Timer stuck, Wind sounds failing

## 🔴 Critical Current Issues

### 1. Timer Bar Stuck in "Waiting for start time" Loop
- Timer bar never starts moving despite startTime being set
- Logs show continuous "Waiting for start time, staying at LEFT"
- The elapsed time calculation (`Date.now() - startTime`) stays negative
- **Root Cause:** Likely timing synchronization issue between component state and actual time

### 2. Wind Sound Files Failing to Load
- Error: `AVPlayer instance has failed with error code -11819`
- Error: `AVPlayerItem instance has failed with error code -11800`
- Affects: WindClick.mp3, possibly WindSSwing.mp3
- **Impact:** Wind mode won't work properly
- **Root Cause:** Either corrupted files or format incompatibility with expo-av

### 3. No Audio Output Confirmed
- Progressive engine starts but no confirmation sounds are actually playing
- Queue remains at 0 (progressive scheduling working but may not be triggering)

## ✅ Fixes Successfully Implemented

### 1. Queue Clearing Bug Fixed
- **File:** `PuttingAudioEngineAV.ts`
- **Fix:** Removed `this.queue = []` from `start()` method
- **Impact:** Sounds are now properly enqueued

### 2. Debounce Guard Added
- **File:** `HomeScreenMinimal.js`
- **Fix:** Added 800ms debounce to prevent double-tap restart
- **Code:**
```javascript
const startGuardRef = useRef(0);
if (now - startGuardRef.current < 800) return;
```

### 3. Pool Duration Windows Adjusted
- **Files:** Both audio engines
- **Fix:** Matched inUse windows to actual clip durations
  - Ready: 550ms
  - Back: 800ms
  - Swing: 950ms
  - Click: 200ms

### 4. Progressive Scheduling Implemented
- **File:** `PuttingAudioEngineAV_Progressive.ts`
- **Fix:** Only schedules sounds within 150ms rolling window
- **Impact:** Prevents 700+ sound queue buildup and GC spikes

### 5. Clock-Based Animation for TimerBar
- **File:** `TimerBar.tsx`
- **Fix:** Replaced Animated API with requestAnimationFrame
- **Status:** ⚠️ Implemented but stuck in waiting loop

## 📊 Current Code Structure

```
/src/audio/
├── PuttingAudioEngineAV.ts           # Original engine (working partially)
├── PuttingAudioEngineAV_Progressive.ts # Progressive version (in use)
└── [other deprecated engines]

/src/ui/
└── TimerBar.tsx                       # Visual timer (stuck waiting)

/screens/
└── HomeScreenMinimal.js               # Main screen (uses Progressive engine)
```

## 🔧 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Fix Timer Bar Start Time Issue
The timer is stuck because `elapsed` stays negative. Need to investigate:
- Is `startTime` prop being passed correctly?
- Is there a timezone/timestamp format issue?
- Should use `startTimeMs` directly instead of converting?

### 2. Debug Progressive Scheduling
- Add logs to see if `scheduleNextSounds()` is being called
- Verify sounds are being added to queue after initial 0
- Check if `playSound()` is ever triggered

### 3. Replace or Fix Wind Sound Files
- Option A: Re-export wind sounds in compatible format
- Option B: Skip wind sounds for now
- Option C: Use different audio library (expo-audio in SDK 54)

## 💡 Quick Debug Commands

Test timer synchronization:
```javascript
// In TimerBar.tsx, add after line 52:
console.log('[TimerBar] Debug:', {
  startTime,
  now: Date.now(),
  elapsed: Date.now() - startTime,
  startTimeType: typeof startTime
});
```

Test progressive scheduling:
```javascript
// In PuttingAudioEngineAV_Progressive.ts, add to scheduleNextSounds():
console.log('[Progressive] Scheduling:', {
  nextBeat: this.nextBeatToSchedule,
  queueLength: this.queue.length,
  scheduleUntil,
  now
});
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria
1. Timer bar moves smoothly in sync with audio
2. Sounds play at correct beat positions
3. No engine restarts or timing drift
4. Works on both iOS and Android devices

## 📝 Session Summary
We identified and fixed the primary queue-clearing bug, implemented all recommended performance optimizations, but discovered new issues with timer synchronization and wind sound compatibility. The progressive scheduling architecture is in place but needs debugging to confirm sounds are actually playing.

## 🚀 To Resume Work
1. Start by adding debug logs suggested above
2. Focus on timer bar synchronization first (visual feedback)
3. Then verify audio is actually playing
4. Finally address wind sound compatibility
