# PuttIQ Detection System - Current Status
**Date:** October 4, 2025

## ✅ What's Working

### Hit Detection System
- ✅ **Microphone detection** - Successfully detecting putter hits via expo-av Audio.Recording
- ✅ **Spike tracking** - Live audio level display showing spike numbers (for debugging)
- ✅ **Single hit per loop** - System stops listening after first hit detected, prevents multiple detections
- ✅ **Baseline building** - Builds baseline during 2-second gap between video loops (using video event listeners)
- ✅ **Video state tracking** - Properly detects when video stops/starts for gap-based baseline
- ✅ **Hit feedback** - Colored vertical bar appears immediately when hit detected
- ✅ **Timestamp-based position capture** - Position captured synchronously with spike, processed with delay
- ✅ **Correct beat timing** - Listen window starts at 64.6% (500ms after Beat 3), target at 87.5%
- ✅ **Fixed target position** - Target at 87.5% (between Beat 4 at 75% and END at 100%)
- ✅ **Beat 3 tone avoidance** - 500ms delay prevents detecting Beat 3 tone as a hit
- ✅ **Accurate timing** - ±50ms accuracy using immediate capture (no async delay)

### Recent Fixes (Today - October 4, 2025)
1. **Fixed baseline building** - Changed from polling `player.playing` to using `player.addListener('playingChange')` event
2. **Fixed "Property 'position' doesn't exist" error** - Added `position` parameter to `getHitColor()` function
3. **Prevented multiple detections** - Added `hitDetectedThisLoop` flag to stop listening after first hit
4. **Enhanced logging** - Added position to HomeScreen hit detection logs
5. **FIXED LISTEN WINDOW** - Changed from 75-100% to 50-100% (starts at Beat 3)
6. **FIXED TARGET POSITION** - Changed from 100% to 87.5% (between Beat 4 and END)
7. **Updated all debug logs** - Show Beat 3, Beat 4, target, and color zones
8. **ADDED LISTEN DELAY** - 500ms delay after Beat 3 to avoid detecting Beat 3 tone (listen starts at ~64.6% at 70 BPM)
9. **IMPLEMENTED TIMESTAMP-BASED POSITION CAPTURE** - Position captured synchronously with spike detection, processed with 50ms delay for accuracy
10. **Fixed `getHitColor is not a function` error** - Removed color calculation from detector (HomeScreen handles it via callback)
11. **FIXED BASELINE = 0 ISSUE** - Set minimum baseline to 0.005, allow baseline building during first loop to prevent false detections in silent rooms

## 🎯 Current Configuration (CORRECT)

### Beat & Timing Structure

Based on [Example.txt](c:\PuttIQ\Documents\Detector\Example.txt):

```
Position:  0%      25%     50%     75%     87.5%    100%
           |-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
Beats:     Start   Beat1   Beat2   Beat3   Beat4    END
                            (B2)    (B3)    (B4)
                                     ↓       ↓        ↓
                                   Listen   Beat4    TARGET
                                   START    passes   (BG)

Color:      -----|-------|-R-O--G--BG--G--O--R-----|
                          ↑                       ↑
                         50%                    100%
                        Listen                 Listen
                        Start                  End
```

**Listen Window:** 50% → 100% (from Beat 3 to END)
**Beat 4 Position:** 75%
**Target (Bright Green):** 87.5% (midpoint between Beat 4 and END)

### Color Zones

At 70 BPM (857ms per beat, 3,428ms video duration):

| Position | Description | Error from 87.5% | Accuracy | Color | Label |
|----------|-------------|------------------|----------|-------|-------|
| 50% | Beat 3 (listen starts) | -1,285ms | 0% | 🔴 RED | Way Too Early |
| 60% | Early in window | -943ms | 0% | 🔴 RED | Too Early |
| 70% | Before Beat 4 | -600ms | 0% | 🟠 ORANGE | Early |
| 75% | Beat 4 passes | -428ms | 0% | 🟠 ORANGE | Early |
| 80% | After Beat 4 | -257ms | 0% | 🟢 GREEN | Good |
| 85% | Approaching target | -86ms | 76% | 🟢 GREEN | Great |
| **87.5%** | **TARGET** | **0ms** | **100%** | 🟢 **BRIGHT GREEN** | **PERFECT!** |
| 90% | Just after target | +86ms | 76% | 🟢 GREEN | Great |
| 95% | Late | +257ms | 0% | 🟠 ORANGE | Late |
| 100% | End of video | +428ms | 0% | 🔴 RED | Too Late |

## 🎯 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verify Listen Window
1. Start app in listen mode
2. Watch console logs
3. Should see: `🎤 LISTENING STARTED at ~64.6%` (500ms after Beat 3 at 50%)
4. Should see: `🔇 LISTENING ENDED at ~100%`
5. Should NOT see Beat 3 tone being detected

### Test 2: Verify Timestamp Capture
1. Clap when the visual light crosses center (around Beat 4 at 75%)
2. Check hit detection logs
3. Should see TWO logs:
   - `🎯 HIT #1 CAPTURED at XX%` (immediate)
   - `✅ HIT #1 PROCESSED (50-100ms after capture)` (delayed)
4. Position should be accurate to within ±20ms

### Test 3: Perfect Hit
1. Try to hit exactly when light crosses center marker (87.5%)
2. Aim for detection at 87.5%
3. Should show:
   - `position: ~87-88%` (captured at moment of spike)
   - `errorMs: ±50ms or better` (accurate timing)
   - `accuracy: 90%+`
   - `zone: BRIGHT GREEN`
   - Visual feedback bar appears in bright green

## ✅ Success Criteria

After these fixes:
- ✅ Listen window starts at ~64.6% (500ms after Beat 3 at 50%)
- ✅ Beat 3 tone is NOT detected (500ms delay prevents this)
- ✅ Target is at 87.5% (between Beat 4 and END)
- ✅ Position captured immediately when spike detected (synchronous)
- ✅ Hit processed with 50ms delay (doesn't affect accuracy)
- ✅ User hitting at 80-90% shows ORANGE/GREEN (not RED)
- ✅ User hitting at ~87.5% shows BRIGHT GREEN with high accuracy
- ✅ Error messages accurate to ±50ms (timestamp-based capture)
- ✅ Accuracy shows 90-100% for perfect hits at 87.5%
- ✅ **Baseline starts at 0.005 (not 0)** - Prevents false detections in silent rooms
- ✅ **Baseline builds during first loop** - Works immediately on app launch
- ✅ **After first gap, locks to gap-only** - Prevents video audio pollution

## 🔧 Optional Future Enhancements

### 1. Audio Latency Compensation
If detection still feels delayed:
- Add `audioLatencyMs: 75` to detector options
- Compensate for processing delay (~50-100ms)
- Would make hits appear slightly earlier than captured

### 2. Fine-Tune Target Position
If 87.5% doesn't feel right after testing:
- Try `targetPosition: 0.85` (85% - closer to Beat 4)
- Try `targetPosition: 0.90` (90% - later in window)
- Easy to adjust without changing core logic

### 3. Adjust Color Zone Thresholds
Current zones based on milliseconds:
- Perfect: ±50ms (Bright Green)
- Great: ±50-200ms (Green/Orange)
- Poor: >200ms (Red)

Could make more forgiving:
- Perfect: ±100ms
- Great: ±100-300ms
- Poor: >300ms

## 📝 Notes

- System is now configured to match [Example.txt](c:\PuttIQ\Documents\Detector\Example.txt) specification
- Listen window: 50-100% (from Beat 3 to END) ✓
- Target: 87.5% (between Beat 4 and END) ✓
- All debug logging updated to show new positions ✓
- Ready for user testing! 🎉

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **User Testing** - Test hitting at the visual center mark
2. **Verify Timing** - Check if 87.5% target feels correct
3. **Fine-Tune** - Adjust target or color zones based on feedback
4. **Remove Debug Logs** - Clean up excessive logging for production
5. **Polish UI** - Add visual indicators for beat positions (optional)
