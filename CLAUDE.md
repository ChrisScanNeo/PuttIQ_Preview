### Phase 2: UI & Core Animation ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
**Objective:** Build the main metronome view with smooth animations

#### Completed:
- ✅ Created main screen layout (HomeScreen.js)
- ✅ Implemented tempo slider (60-100 BPM range)
- ✅ Added visual beat indicators (dots that alternate)
- ✅ Created START/STOP button with color states
- ✅ Added feedback text display
- ✅ Implemented useMetronome hook for timing logic
- ✅ Created TimingBar component with animated marker
- ✅ Implemented back-and-forth motion animation

#### Animation Implementation Example:
```tsx
const progress = useSharedValue(0);

useEffect(() => {
  progress.value = withRepeat(
    withTiming(1, { duration: 60000 / bpm }),
    -1,
    true // reverse direction
  );
}, [bpm]);

const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
  transform: [{ translateX: interpolate(progress.value, [0, 1], [-100, 100]) }],
}));
```

- **Navigator:** `/MinimalNavigator.js` - Simple navigation wrapper
- **Firebase Config:** `/services/firebase.js` - Backend configuration
- **Auth:** `/services/auth.js` - Device-based authentication
- **App Entry:** `/App.js` - Application entry point
- **Assets:**
  - `/assets/swingBars/` - Video files organized by sound type
  - `/assets/icons/` - Custom PNG icons
  - `/assets/ball/` - Golf ball images (PNG/SVG)

## 🧑‍💻 Development Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

## 📱 Current App Status

### What's Working Now (v2.0):
- ✅ App launches in landscape mode with grass background
- ✅ Video timing bars display at top of screen
- ✅ Interactive golf ball with click to start/stop text
- ✅ BPM control (70-80) with +/- buttons using custom icons
- ✅ Sound type selection (Tone/Beat/Wind) with custom icons
- ✅ Dynamic video loading based on BPM + sound type
- ✅ Controls lock during playback (dimmed at 50% opacity)
- ✅ Video loops continuously when playing
- ✅ Firebase stores user data (when online)
- ✅ Works offline with cached data
- ✅ No login required (device-based auth)
- ✅ Responsive layout with safe areas

### What's Not Yet Implemented:
- ❌ Complete video library (only 70 BPM available for each type)
- ❌ Microphone hit detection
- ❌ Timing accuracy feedback and scoring
- ❌ In-app purchase unlock
- ❌ Settings screen
- ❌ Practice history/stats tracking

## 📝 Notes & Best Practices
- **Video Files:** Use naming convention `{SoundType}_{BPM}BPM.mp4` (e.g., Tones_75BPM.mp4)
- **Git Workflow:** Commit and push changes after testing, include descriptive notes
- **Testing:** Test on actual devices via custom dev client (Expo Go has limitations)
- **Video Loading:** React Native requires static `require()` paths - update videoMap in HomeScreen.js when adding new videos
- **BPM Range:** Currently fixed at 70-80 BPM (can be expanded later)
- **Performance:** Videos should be optimized for mobile playback (H.264 codec recommended)
- **Landscape Mode:** All layouts optimized for landscape orientation for golf stance
- **Safe Areas:** UI respects device safe areas (notches, home indicators)
