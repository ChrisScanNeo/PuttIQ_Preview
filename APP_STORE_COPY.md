**WHAT MAKES PUTTIQ DIFFERENT**

Unlike generic metronome apps, PuttIQ is specifically engineered for golf putting. Our timing windows, sound profiles, and visual feedback are calibrated to the biomechanics of a proper putting stroke. Every element is designed to help you develop tour-quality tempo.

**DEVELOP MUSCLE MEMORY**

Consistent practice with PuttIQ creates neural pathways that make perfect tempo automatic. Your body learns the rhythm, freeing your mind to focus on line and distance. The result? More confidence, better consistency, and lower scores.

**TRAINING BACKED BY SCIENCE**

Rhythm-based training is proven to improve motor skill performance. By synchronizing your putting stroke with consistent audio-visual cues, you accelerate skill development and build repeatable muscle memory faster than traditional practice alone.
