Comprehensive Implementation Plan

Install Dependencies
First, let’s make sure we have everything we need. You already have expo-av. Now add an audio recording library, like react-native-audio:

expo install expo-av
npm install react-native-audio


Also, ensure you have permissions set up for recording audio on both platforms. Expo's docs can guide you through that.

Configure the Audio Mode
Before playing or recording anything, we’ll set the audio mode to ensure we use the main speaker and the microphone together:

import { Audio } from 'expo-av';

async function setAudioMode() {
  await Audio.setAudioModeAsync({
    allowsRecordingIOS: true,  // Allow recording on iOS
    playsInSilentModeIOS: true,  // Ensure it works in silent mode
    staysActiveInBackground: false,
    interruptionModeIOS: Audio.INTERRUPTION_MODE_IOS_DO_NOT_MIX,
    interruptionModeAndroid: Audio.INTERRUPTION_MODE_ANDROID_DO_NOT_MIX,
    shouldDuckAndroid: true,
    playThroughEarpieceAndroid: false  // Ensures main speaker on Android
  });
}

// Call this function when your component mounts or before you start playing/recording
useEffect(() => {
  setAudioMode();
}, []);


Set Up Video Playback with expo-av
Load and play your video as we discussed. This will give us the timing cues for when to start listening.

import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Video } from 'expo-av';

const PuttDetection = () => {
  const videoRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (videoRef.current) {
      videoRef.current.playAsync();
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <Video
      ref={videoRef}
      source={require('./path/to/your/video.mp4')}
      rate={1.0}
      volume={1.0}
      isMuted={false}
      resizeMode="cover"
      shouldPlay
      isLooping={false}
      onPlaybackStatusUpdate={status => {
        // Check status.positionMillis to know when to start listening
      }}
      style={{ width: 300, height: 300 }}
    />
  );
};


Initialize and Control the Audio Recorder
Set up the audio recorder so it starts recording right before the third beat goes silent and then analyze the snippet after that. We’ll have a variable that ignores all audio until the correct time and then listens for the putt sound.

import { AudioRecorder, AudioUtils } from 'react-native-audio';

// Initialize the recorder
const initRecorder = async () => {
  // Set up recorder options
  // ...

  // Prepare the recorder
  AudioRecorder.prepareRecordingAtPath(AudioUtils.DocumentDirectoryPath + '/puttSound.aac', {
    SampleRate: 44100,
    Channels: 1,
    AudioQuality: 'High',
    AudioEncoding: 'aac'
  });
};

// Call this before you start the video so the recorder is ready
useEffect(() => {
  initRecorder();
}, []);

// Measure timing after the silence
const startListeningForPutt = async () => {
  // Start recording right before the silent beat
  await AudioRecorder.startRecording();

  // After the silent beat, check for putt sound and measure timing
  // ...
};

// We’ll kind of record a small window of audio and analyze it here


Putting It All Together
With the audio mode set, video playback running, and the recorder listening at the right moment, you’ll have a full loop. You just measure the timing of the putt impact after the third beat’s silence and you’re good to go.

So that should give you a nice, clean setup. You’ll have the video running, the main speaker active, the microphone listening only when needed, and a nice little detection logic that’s all platform-agnostic in Expo.
