# Putting Rhythm Trainer — React Native App Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Goal

A cross-platform mobile app that helps golfers perfect their putting rhythm using:

- A smooth, animated metronome bar and golf ball
- Audio feedback from the microphone to detect putter hits
- Simple feedback on timing accuracy (e.g. “Perfect!”, “Early”, “Late”)
- A **one-time unlock** via in-app purchase (IAP) on both iOS and Android

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer       | Tool / Framework                   | Purpose                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| UI          | React Native (Expo Bare or CLI)    | Cross-platform framework                 |
| Animations  | `react-native-reanimated v3`       | Physics-based animation (e.g. spring)    |
| Graphics    | `react-native-svg`, `react-native-skia` | Custom vector shapes, animations     |
| Audio Input | `react-native-sound-level` or `react-native-audio-recorder-player` | For real-time audio detection |
| Payments    | `react-native-iap`                 | Handles App Store and Play Store IAP     |

## ✨ App Flow and Features

### 1. 🖼 Main Screen (Metronome View)

- Center golf ball image
- Animated bar swinging left and right like a metronome
- Feedback text appears after each swing:
  - "Perfect!" (within tolerance)
  - "Too Early"
  - "Too Late"

#### UI Structure Example


+------------------------------------+
| Putting Rhythm |
| |
| ← 🏌️‍♂️ → |
| (animated swing bar) |
| |
| 🏌️ Golf Ball |
| |
| Feedback: “Perfect!” 🟢 |
| |
| Tempo: [60 BPM] (slider) |
+------------------------------------+

## 🎞 Professional Animation Design

Use `react-native-reanimated v3` + `react-native-svg` or `react-native-skia` to:

### 🟢 Animate the Metronome Bar

- **Left-right swing animation**: based on tempo (BPM)
- Use `withRepeat`, `withTiming`, or `withSpring` for continuous swing
- Wrap the bar in an `Animated.View` and use a transform for smooth motion

```tsx
const progress = useSharedValue(0);

useEffect(() => {
  progress.value = withRepeat(
    withTiming(1, { duration: 60000 / bpm }),
    -1,
    true // reverse direction
  );
}, [bpm]);

const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
  transform: [{ translateX: interpolate(progress.value, [0, 1], [-100, 100]) }],
}));

🟠 Animate the Feedback

Use FadeInUp or ZoomIn from react-native-reanimated for score text

Optional: pulse or flash color (green for "Perfect", red for "Too Early")

🔊 Audio Detection (Putter Hit)

Choose one of these libraries:

Option 1: react-native-sound-level

Continuously listens to mic input

Detects sudden spikes in volume

Very lightweight and simple

SoundLevel.onNewFrame = (data) => {
  if (data.value > threshold) {
    const now = Date.now();
    // Compare to swing timing here
  }
};

Option 2: react-native-audio-recorder-player

Use if you want to also record short clips or analyze waveforms

Slightly more overhead but better control

💳 In-App Purchase (One-Time Unlock)

Use react-native-iap
:

1. Setup Products in Stores
🔵 Apple App Store

Go to App Store Connect → My Apps → [Your App]

Under “In-App Purchases”, add a non-consumable product

Product ID: putting_metronome_unlock

Price Tier: £3.99 or similar

🟢 Google Play Store

Go to Google Play Console → Monetization setup

Add a Managed Product

Same Product ID: putting_metronome_unlock

One-time purchase

2. Install and Configure IAP Library
npm install react-native-iap
npx pod-install

3. Code Implementation
import * as RNIap from 'react-native-iap';

const itemSkus = ['putting_metronome_unlock'];

useEffect(() => {
  RNIap.initConnection().then(() => {
    RNIap.getProducts(itemSkus).then(setProducts);
  });
}, []);

const buy = async () => {
  try {
    const purchase = await RNIap.requestPurchase(itemSkus[0]);
    // Unlock app here — store in AsyncStorage or Firebase
  } catch (err) {
    Alert.alert('Purchase failed');
  }
};

🧠 Unlock Logic

Use one of these options:

Option	Description
🔒 AsyncStorage	Save a flag locally: isUnlocked = true
☁️ Firebase	(Optional) Store purchases against a UID

On every app load:

Check if the purchase was previously made

If not, show a locked version of the UI with a “Buy Unlock” button

🧪 Testing Checklist

 Metronome animation works smoothly at 60–100 BPM

 Audio detection fires correctly when putter hits

 Timing feedback logic is accurate ± tolerance

 IAP flow works end-to-end on test accounts

 Locked vs Unlocked logic works on fresh installs

 Clean UI layout on both iOS and Android

📦 Optional Features (After MVP)

Different stroke profiles (e.g., putter, iron, driver)

Score history: track user's improvement over time

Partner code system for revenue share (basic referral links)

Leaderboard of accuracy % (Firebase or Supabase)
