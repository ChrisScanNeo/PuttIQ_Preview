# Codespaces Limitations for iOS Development

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: iOS Build Limitations

GitHub Codespaces runs on **Linux**, which means:

### ‚ùå Cannot Do in Codespaces:
- Build iOS apps (requires macOS + Xcode)
- Run `pod install` successfully (needs Xcode tools)
- Test on iOS simulator (macOS only)
- Create iOS builds locally

### ‚úÖ Can Do in Codespaces:
- Develop all JavaScript/React Native code
- Test with Expo Go (without native modules)
- Build Android apps
- Use EAS Build for cloud iOS builds
- Write and test iOS native module code (but not compile)

## üì± iOS Testing Solutions

### Option 1: EAS Build (Recommended)
**Build iOS apps in the cloud without a Mac:**

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo account
eas login

# Configure build
eas build:configure

# Build for iOS (in cloud)
eas build --platform ios --profile development

# Download .ipa file when ready
# Install via TestFlight or Ad Hoc distribution
```

### Option 2: Mac in Cloud Services
- **MacStadium**: Rent a Mac in the cloud
- **MacinCloud**: Pay-per-hour Mac access
- **AWS EC2 Mac**: Amazon's Mac instances

### Option 3: Local Mac Development
If you have access to a Mac:
1. Clone the repository on Mac
2. Run `cd ios && pod install`
3. Open in Xcode and build

## ü§ñ Android Testing (Works in Codespaces!)

Android development works perfectly in Codespaces:

```bash
# Install Android SDK (if needed)
# Already configured in most Codespaces

# Build Android app
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on connected device/emulator
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## üéØ Recommended Workflow

1. **Develop in Codespaces** - Write all code, test with Expo Go fallback
2. **Build with EAS** - Cloud builds for both platforms
3. **Test on Devices** - Download builds and test native features

### For Your Current Situation:

Since you're in Codespaces and trying to test the native audio module:

```bash
# Option 1: Use EAS Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile development

# Option 2: Test Android locally (works in Codespaces)
npx expo run:android

# Option 3: Continue development with Expo Go (uses fallback)
npx expo start --tunnel
```

The native module code is ready and will work when built properly on the target platform!
