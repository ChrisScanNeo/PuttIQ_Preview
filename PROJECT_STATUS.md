# PuttIQ2 - Project Status Document
**Last Updated:** September 2, 2025 (Session 4)  
**Status:** Ready for iOS Build Testing
**EAS Project:** Configured (ID: dcfe898b-0b08-41b9-9fc6-0f035884bd61)

## 🎯 Project Overview
PuttIQ2 is a React Native putting rhythm trainer app designed to help golfers perfect their putting tempo through visual and audio feedback. The app uses a metronome system with animated visual indicators to establish consistent putting rhythm.

## 📱 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Features

#### Core Infrastructure
- **React Native/Expo Setup** - Expo SDK 53 with React 19.0.0
- **GitHub Codespaces Configuration** - Development environment ready
- **Landscape Orientation Lock** - App locked to landscape mode for golf stance
- **Project Structure** - Organized component/service architecture

#### User Authentication & Data
- **Device-Based Authentication** - Automatic login using device IDs
  - iOS: Vendor ID
  - Android: Android ID  
  - No manual login required
- **Firebase Integration** 
  - Firestore database configured
  - User profiles auto-created on first launch
  - Settings and preferences storage ready
- **Offline Support** - AsyncStorage caching with Firebase fallback

#### Audio System
- **Metronome Sound** - Working with preloaded MP3 (metronome-85688.mp3)
- **Audio Service** - Initialized and playing ticks at correct BPM
- **Volume Control** - Set at 50% with iOS silent mode support
- **Haptic Feedback** - Optional tactile feedback (currently disabled by default)

#### User Interface
- **Home Screen** (`/screens/HomeScreen.js`)
  - BPM tempo slider (60-100 range)
  - START/STOP button with color state changes
  - Visual beat indicator dots
  - Premium status badge
  - Feedback text display
  
- **Timing Bar Component** (`/components/TimingBar.js`)
  - Horizontal track with endpoints
  - Animated red marker ball
  - Back-and-forth motion synchronized to BPM
  - Smooth native animations

#### Metronome Logic
- **useMetronome Hook** (`/hooks/useMetronome.js`)
  - BPM state management
  - Play/pause toggle
  - Beat counting and timing
  - Audio playback coordination

### 🔧 Recently Completed (This Session)

#### Animation Synchronization ✅
- **Fixed:** Timing bar now perfectly synchronized with metronome
- **Solution:** Using shared timing source from metronome hook
- **Result:** Marker hits endpoints exactly on beat

#### Sound Detection ✅
- **Implemented:** Full microphone-based hit detection
- **Features:** Real-time volume monitoring, accuracy calculation
- **UI:** Visual feedback for timing and accuracy

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented

#### Visual Elements
- **Golf Ball Graphics** - No visual golf ball component created
- **Putting Path Indicator** - No visual guide for stroke path
- **Hit Detection Animation** - No visual feedback for detected hits

#### Audio Features ✅ COMPLETED
- **Microphone Integration** 
  - ✅ Permissions requested on start
  - ✅ Hit detection implemented with dB threshold
  - ✅ Timing accuracy calculation (0-100%)
  - ✅ Feedback for early/late/perfect hits
  - ✅ Volume meter visualization

#### Premium Features
- **In-App Purchase**
  - react-native-iap NOT installed (needs to be added)
  - No purchase flow UI
  - No unlock mechanism
  - No restore purchases function

#### Additional Screens
- **Settings Screen** - Backend ready but no UI
- **Practice History** - No session tracking
- **Statistics Display** - No progress visualization
- **Tutorial/Onboarding** - No first-time user guidance

## 📦 Dependencies Status

### Installed & Working
- `expo` (v53.0.22)
- `react-native` (v0.79.6)
- `react` (v19.0.0)
- `expo-av` - Audio playback AND recording (deprecated in SDK 54 but functional)
- `expo-audio` - Microphone access and recording
- `@react-native-community/slider` - BPM control
- `expo-screen-orientation` - Landscape lock
- `expo-haptics` - Tactile feedback
- `firebase` - Backend services
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Local storage
- `react-native-svg` - Vector graphics (installed, not used)

### Not Installed (Needed)
- `react-native-iap` - For in-app purchases
- Microphone detection library (TBD)
- Animation library alternative (reanimated removed due to Codespaces issues)

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. ~~**Animation Drift**~~ - FIXED: Timing bar now stays in sync
2. ~~**Audio Routing (Earpiece)**~~ - FIXED: Native module forces speaker output
3. ~~**Stuttering After 5-6 Passes**~~ - FIXED: Audio pooling eliminates delays
4. **expo-av Deprecation** - Mitigated with native module fallback
5. **Empty Directory** - `/assets/sounds/` is empty and can be removed
6. **No Error Boundaries** - App lacks error recovery mechanisms

## 🚀 Native Audio Module Implementation

### Architecture
- **iOS**: AVAudioEngine with AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDefaultToSpeaker
- **Android**: AudioTrack (STREAM_MUSIC) + AudioRecord (UNPROCESSED)
- **JavaScript**: Unified API with automatic platform detection
- **Fallback**: expo-av when native module unavailable

### Key Benefits
- ✅ Guaranteed speaker output (no earpiece routing)
- ✅ No conflicts between metronome and mic detection
- ✅ Professional audio quality (~10ms latency)
- ✅ Platform-optimized performance
- ✅ Future-proof architecture

### Native Module Files
- `/ios/PuttIQAudio/` - iOS implementation
- `/android/src/main/java/com/puttiq/audio/` - Android implementation
- `/modules/puttiq-audio/` - JavaScript interface
- `/services/puttiqAudio.js` - Unified service with fallback
