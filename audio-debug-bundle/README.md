# Audio Playback Debug Bundle

## Problem Description
The PuttIQ golf putting rhythm trainer app is not playing any sounds on iOS devices, despite sounds being successfully loaded.

## Current Status
- ✅ All 24 sounds load successfully with `isLoaded: true`
- ✅ Sound files are cached locally on device
- ✅ Audio engine initializes properly
- ❌ No audio output when sounds should play
- ❌ Engine appears to stop immediately after starting (see logs)

## Architecture
- **Library**: expo-av (deprecated but still functional in SDK 54)
- **Pattern**: Sound pooling with 3 pre-loaded players per sound type
- **Modes**: 3 audio modes (metronome, tones, wind)
- **Timing**: 4-beat cycle at specified BPM (60-100)

## Sound Files Structure
```
assets/sounds/
├── Metronome/
│   └── ToneClick.mp3
├── tones/
│   ├── ToneReady.mp3
│   ├── ToneBack.mp3
│   └── ToneSwing.mp3
└── wind/
    ├── WindReady.mp3
    ├── WindBack.mp3
    ├── WindSSwing.mp3
    └── WindClick.mp3
```

## Expected Behavior
1. User clicks golf ball to start
2. Timer bar animates left to right over 2 beats, then right to left over 2 beats
3. Sounds play at each beat position:
   - Beat 0 (LEFT): Click only
   - Beat 1 (1/3 position): Ready tone + Click
   - Beat 2 (2/3 position): Backswing tone + Click
   - Beat 3 (RIGHT): Downswing tone + Click
   - Cycle repeats

## Actual Behavior
- Sounds load successfully
- Engine starts and schedules sounds
- Engine immediately stops (see "Stopping engine" in logs)
- No audio output at all
- Timer bar animates correctly

## Key Files in Bundle
1. **PuttingAudioEngineAV.ts** - Main audio engine using expo-av
2. **HomeScreenMinimal.js** - Screen component that controls audio
3. **TimerBar.tsx** - Visual timer bar component
4. **package.json** - Dependencies

## Debugging Logs Show
```
LOG  [PuttingAudioAV] ✅ INITIALIZATION COMPLETE:
LOG    - metronome-click: 3 sounds loaded
LOG    - tones-ready: 3 sounds loaded
...
LOG  [PuttingAudioAV] Starting engine
LOG  [TimerBar] Waiting for start time, staying at LEFT
LOG  [PuttingAudioAV] Stopping engine  <-- PROBLEM: Stops immediately!
```

## Questions to Investigate
1. Why does the engine stop immediately after starting?
2. Are the sounds actually playing but muted/routed incorrectly?
3. Is there an iOS-specific audio session configuration issue?
4. Is the tick interval actually running to trigger sounds?

## Environment
- Expo SDK 54
- React Native 0.81.4
- expo-av 16.0.7
- iOS device (physical iPhone)
- Testing via Expo Go app
